## Automated Power Point Insight Generator
An automated system that converts raw CSV data into ready to use Power Point slides with charts and summaries

## 1. Problem Overview
In many analytics and marketing teams, analysts waste hours every week manually creating PowerPoint slides.
The workflow is always the same:

Download the CSV

Clean or filter the data

Create charts

Copy–paste them into slides

Repeat this for 20–50 slides

It’s repetitive, time-consuming, and adds zero real analytical value.

I wanted to eliminate this entire manual process.
